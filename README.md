# OpenHomeRegister
This is the utility for realestate agent to register visitors at home inspection time.

I was tring to use Parse as the backend server for my mobile apps, this is the first mobile app using Parse. 

This App was published to Apple Store and unpublished after Parse annoanced that Parse will be retired.

It is using Pod, so before you build, you need to run pod install and open OpenHome.xcworkspace file.

You also need Parse key to run this app.
